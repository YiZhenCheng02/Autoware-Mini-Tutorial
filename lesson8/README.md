# Lesson 8 - Testing in the CARLA simulator

In this final lesson, you will run the whole framework from the previous lessons in closed loop inside the CARLA simulator: the simulated world reacts to your vehicle, and your vehicle must react to the world.

Two tools are used for the closed-loop validation:
* [**CARLA**](https://carla.org/) - an open-source autonomous driving simulator. It renders the world via provided map files (and we will use our own Tartu map), simulates the physics and the sensors (lidar, cameras), and feeds them to your nodes through ROS topics.
* **Visual Scenario Editor (VSE)** - a graphical tool for creating and re-playing driving scenarios in CARLA: NPC vehicles and pedestrians with routes and triggers, traffic light sequences and weather. See the [VSE repository](https://github.com/UT-ADL/visual-scenario-editor) and [how to use the editor](https://github.com/UT-ADL/visual-scenario-editor/blob/main/tutorial.md).

You will first verify that your framework can drive in CARLA, then run it through a prepared VSE scenario, and finally design scenarios yourself where your framework fails.

### Expected outcome
* Understanding how the full autonomous driving stack behaves in a closed-loop simulation
* Exploring the limits of the framework you built


## 1. Run your stack in CARLA

The launch file [lesson8.launch](launch/lesson8.launch) connects your nodes from the previous lessons to CARLA. There is no bag playback: the localization comes from the simulator, and the vehicle commands from your `pure_pursuit_follower` steer the car in the simulation.

By default the detected objects and traffic light statuses come from the simulator's ground truth instead of your perception nodes - simulating the lidar and the cameras is very heavy, and running the perception pipeline on them can slow the simulation down to a crawl. Your planner and controller are still the ones driving. If your machine can afford it, you can enable your own perception with `detector:=cluster` (lesson 5 nodes on the simulated lidar) and/or `tfl_detector:=yolo` (lesson 7 nodes on the simulated cameras).

##### Instructions
1. Start the CARLA simulator:
    ```
    $CARLA_ROOT/CarlaUE4.sh -prefernvidia -RenderOffScreen
    ```
2. In another terminal, launch your stack:
    ```
    roslaunch autoware_mini_tutorial lesson8.launch
    ```

##### Validation
* RViz opens with the Tartu map and the ego vehicle placed in the simulated city
* The `Carla image view` panel shows the third-person view of the ego vehicle in the simulated world
* Place a goal on the map - the vehicle drives to it


## 2. Run the demo scenario

A driving scenario adds actors to the otherwise empty world: NPC vehicles and pedestrians that spawn, move and react when triggered, and traffic lights that switch according to the scenario triggers. You will run the prepared demo lap scenario and see whether your framework survives traffic.

When your stack is running, VSE automatically detects your ego vehicle and hands the driving over to it - the scenario provides the destination, the other actors and the evaluation.

##### Instructions
1. With `lesson8.launch` running, start VSE and open the `tartu_demo` map. When VSE first launches, it will ask to select the agent's behavior logic. Navigate to `autoware_mini/nodes/platform/carla/` and select `carla_minimal_agent.py`.
2. Open the scenario (`Scenario` menu -> `Open`): `shared/data/scenarios/tartu_demo_route_simplified.json` from the tutorial folder
3. Press **Play**. Note: if your machine has less than 10 Gb VRAM slowdowns are expected.

##### Validation
* The goal appears in RViz automatically and the vehicle starts driving the demo lap
* NPC vehicles and pedestrians act out the scenario around the ego vehicle
* When the run ends, VSE shows a results window scoring the drive (collisions, red light violations, route completion); the same results are also saved as a text file next to the scenario JSON


## 3. Create three failure cases

Your framework from the previous lessons is a simplified one. Remember all limitations that were discussed through the lessons. In this final task you will demonstrate these limits: create three scenarios where your framework fails.

##### Instructions
1. Copy `tartu_demo_route_simplified.json` (e.g. to `failure_case_1.json`) and modify it in VSE - move, add, retime or reroute actors and triggers until your stack demonstrably fails, while a careful human driver would still manage
2. For every failure case, think of a specific change to the framework that would fix it. You do not need implement the fix. The three cases should have three different proposed fixes.
3. Create a `lesson8/scenarios/` folder in your repository and commit the three scenario JSONs there
4. Fill in the three descriptions below: what happens in the scenario, how your framework fails, and what change to the framework would fix it. Add screenshots if needed.
5. Commit and push everything, and be ready to demonstrate your failure cases at the practice session

##### Failure case 1
* **Scenario:** An NPC vehicle traveling in an adjacent lane attempts to change lanes (cut-in) right in front of the ego vehicle.
* **Failure:** The ego vehicle did not detect that the other vehicle was trying to change lanes until it was fully in its path. It failed to anticipate the lateral movement and maintain a safe following distance, resulting in a near collision.
* **Proposed Fix:** Add a lane change detection feature to notice when adjacent cars start moving sideways, along with an adaptive speed controller to slow our car down early when a cut-in is detected. 

##### Failure case 2
* **Scenario:** A jaywalking person suddenly sprints directly in front of the ego vehicle.
* **Failure:** The ego vehicle's perception and planning loops react too late. The pure pursuit follower and basic velocity controller cannot overcome the vehicle's forward momentum fast enough to stop, leading to a crash with the jaywalker.
* **Proposed Fix:** Add a fast-reacting Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) system. This would bypass the normal, slower driving controls to slam on the brakes the moment a sudden collision risk is detected.

##### Failure case 3
* **Scenario:** A stationary car is parked directly in front of the ego vehicle, mimicking a broken-down vehicle blocking the lane.
* **Failure:** The ego vehicle successfully detects the obstacle and stops, but it fails to change lanes. Ego car is stuck indefinitely and cannot continue the scenario. 
* **Proposed Fix:** Add a dynamic local path planner. Instead of just stopping because the pre-drawn map line is blocked, this would allow the car to calculate a temporary detour to safely steer around the broken-down car.
